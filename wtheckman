Each Node represents a node in the Huffman tree.

data stores the frequency of a character or combined frequencies of child nodes.

left and right point to child nodes.

__lt__ is defined to make the Node class comparable, which is needed for the heapq (priority queue). The heap will compare nodes based on their data (frequency).

Each frequency becomes a node in a min-head
•	Take the two smallest frequency nodes (l and r).
•	Create a new internal node combining them (l.data + r.data).
•	Push the new node back to the heap.
•	Repeat until one node remains → the root of the Huffman Tree.
Then it will generate the code and Perform preorder traversal to generate codes for all characters.
